              <h3 class="timeline-title">On-Call Operations Manager</h3>

              <p class="timeline-text">
                Operated in a retail environment with fluctuating customer
                demand, seasonal traffic spikes, and limited visibility into
                product performance, where inventory decisions directly affected
                sales outcomes. Planning was largely reactive, relying on
                intuition rather than evidence, which led to stock imbalances
                and missed opportunities during peak periods. Working within the
                limits of historical sales data and irregular demand patterns, I
                analyzed past performance to identify trends, high-performing
                products, and seasonal behavior, and translated these findings
                into forecasting dashboards for monthly and peak-season
                planning. This reduced guesswork in purchasing decisions,
                improved inventory balance during high-traffic periods, and
                strengthened my ability to turn raw operational data into
                actionable business insight.

                Freelance — Inventory System Developer
              </h3>

              <p class="timeline-text">
                Worked with a multi-category retail business that lacked
                centralized visibility into inventory, relying on manual
                tracking methods that caused frequent discrepancies, delayed
                reporting, and weak accountability across roles. The solution
                needed to operate within a small team, limited budget, and
                non-technical user base, while still supporting real-time access
                and remote oversight. I designed and built a centralized
                inventory management system with controlled access, audit
                tracking, real-time stock updates, and automated alerts, then
                deployed and maintained it in production for daily operational
                use. The system enabled managers to monitor inventory in real
                time, reduced manual reconciliation errors, and reinforced the
                importance of aligning data models, access control, and system
                responsibilities before implementation.
