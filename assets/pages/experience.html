                  - Operated in a retail environment with fluctuating demand,

                <li>
                  - Addressed reactive, intuition-based inventory planning that

                  - Analyzed historical sales data to identify trends,

                  - Developed forecasting dashboards to support monthly and

                  - Reduced purchasing guesswork, improved stock balance during
